# <i class="fa fa-terminal"></i> JHipster Shell Plugins

Shell plugins bring additional shortcuts for using JHipster, which makes it faster and easier to use. If you've seen people having a beautiful shell, with nice auto-completion and ultra-fast shortcuts, the magic comes from here!

Currently there are two shell plugins:

* [Oh-My-Zsh JHipster plugin]({{ site.url }}/oh-my-zsh/) for [Oh-My-Zsh](http://ohmyz.sh/)
* [Fisherman JHipster plugin]({{ site.url }}/fisherman/) for [Fisherman](http://fisherman.sh/)
